## [1.0.0] — 2025-02-24

### ✨ Added — Complete rewrite for Grafana 10+

This is a full rewrite of the abandoned `serrrios-statusoverview-panel` plugin with no shared code.

#### Visual
- Status levels: OK, Information, Warning, Average, High, Disaster, Disabled, N/A
- Blink animation on status change with configurable duration (5–60 seconds)
- Colorize each metric individually by its own status color
- Configurable corner radius (0–50 px)
- Icon support: None / Built-in Grafana icons / Custom URL image
- Tag label in the top-left corner
- Timestamp of last status change in the top-right corner (Time / Date+Time / Relative)
- Panel link URL with Grafana variable support
- Custom text color with auto-contrast fallback
- Separate font size controls for title and metrics

#### Sound
- 5 built-in alert tones via Web Audio API (one per severity level)
- Custom audio URL (MP3/OGG) per status level
- Per-status mode: Off / Built-in / Custom URL
- Master volume slider (0–100%)
- Preview button for each sound in settings

#### Rules
- Regex metric matching with real-time validation and error highlighting
- Number threshold, String threshold, and Show-only display modes
- Reverse logic (trigger when value ≤ threshold)
- Drag & drop rule reordering via `@dnd-kit`
- Duplicate rule with one click
- Export / Import rules to/from JSON
- Search filter (appears when more than 3 rules)
- Metric URL per rule (click metric name to open URL)
- Description tooltip on hover

#### Reliability
- Switch to N/A on data source error (prevents false-green status)
- Custom error message when data source fails
- No flicker during Grafana refresh cycles

#### Developer
- Full TypeScript rewrite with strict typing
- Separated hooks: `useStatusTransition`, `useAlertSound`
- Unit tests for `colorResolver`, `comparisonFunctions`, `displayBuilder`, `statusResolver`

#### Migration
- `migrate_panel.py` — Python script for automated migration of existing dashboards from the old plugin format
